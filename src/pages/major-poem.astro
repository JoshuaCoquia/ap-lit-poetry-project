	<h2>Major Poem</h2>
	<h3><i>Traveling through the Dark</i></h3>
	<p>"Traveling through the dark I found a deer <br>
		dead on the edge of the Wilson River road. <br>
		It is usually best to roll them into the canyon: <br>
		that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead. <br>
		<br>
		By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car <br>
		and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing; <br>
		she had stiffened already, almost cold. <br>
		I dragged her off; she was large in the belly. <br>
		<br>
		My fingers touching her side brought me the reason— <br>
		her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting, <br>
		alive, still, never to be born. <br>
		Beside that mountain road I hesitated. <br>
		<br>
		The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights; <br>
		under the hood purred the steady engine. <br>
		I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red; <br>  
		around our group I could hear the wilderness listen. <br>
		<br>
		I thought hard for us all—my only swerving—, <br>  
		then pushed her over the edge into the river." <br>
